        <li>2.5 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>0.5 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball</li>
        <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to drain.</li>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.</li>
    </ol>
